# Data and analysis for the eel_mystery website

 This will be my data and analysis repository for the website "The mystery eels of Prospect Park", my first project for Lede 2024. Initial commit contains only the [original csv](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Urban-Park-Ranger-Animal-Condition-Response/fuhs-xmg2/about_data) I downloaded from New York City's open data portal (park_animals.csv) and its data dictionary and the csvs I saved from my jupyter notebook and turned into charts in datawrapper.

 My code notebook requires some cleaning before uploading, but I will be adding it here later this week. I believe all the other elements for the project are now online.
